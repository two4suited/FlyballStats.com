dotnet run --project src/flyballstats.ApiService

# Web Frontend (expects API service via service discovery)
dotnet run --project src/flyballstats.Web
```

### Accessing the Application

Once running, you can access:

- **Web Application**: https://localhost:7042 (or URL shown in console)
- **Aspire Dashboard**: https://localhost:15888 (monitoring and diagnostics)
- **API Documentation**: https://localhost:7042/openapi (development only)
- **Health Checks**: Available at `/health` endpoints (development only)

### Environment Configuration

The application uses standard ASP.NET Core configuration. Key settings can be configured via:

- `appsettings.json` - Default configuration
- `appsettings.Development.json` - Development overrides
- Environment variables - Production configuration
- Azure App Configuration - Cloud configuration management

## Development

### Project Structure

The solution follows .NET Aspire patterns with clear separation of concerns:

```

└── flyballstats.Tests/            # Unit and integration tests
    └── *.Tests.cs                 # Test files
```

### Key Architecture Patterns

#### Service Discovery
Services communicate using Aspire's built-in service discovery. Example from Web to API:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<TournamentApiClient>(client =>
{
    // Service discovery resolves "apiservice" to the actual endpoint
    client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://apiservice");
});
```

#### Health Checks
All services implement health checks via `MapDefaultEndpoints()`:

```csharp
// Available at /health in development
app.MapDefaultEndpoints();
```

#### Observability
Comprehensive telemetry is automatically configured through ServiceDefaults:

- **Metrics**: Performance counters and custom metrics
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: Distributed request tracing across services

### Development Workflow

#### Local Development Setup

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   aspire run
   ```

2. **Make Code Changes**
   - Edit files in any project
   - Hot reload is enabled for Blazor components
   - API changes require restart

3. **View Logs and Metrics**
   - Open Aspire dashboard at https://localhost:15888
   - Monitor service health, logs, and performance

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test src/flyballstats.sln

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test src/flyballstats.sln --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test project
dotnet test src/flyballstats.Tests/
```

#### Debugging Services

- **Aspire Dashboard**: Use for service logs, metrics, and tracing
- **Browser DevTools**: For Blazor client-side debugging
